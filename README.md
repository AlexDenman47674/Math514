In today's knowledge-based economy, universities play a crucial role in driving innovation, fostering research, and producing highly skilled graduates who contribute to the growth of society. Measuring and evaluating university performance is essential to ensure that they are fulfilling their missions effectively. We will discuss the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) and the Research Excellence Framework (REF), which are national assessments of university research quality in the UK. Additionally, we will examine the parameters related to the quality of teaching and the student experience, such as graduates' earning power, career satisfaction, and broader societal contributions. The Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) will also be discussed which is designed to incentivise excellence in teaching, learning, and student outcomes. By understanding the parameters, proxies, and approximations used to evaluate university performance, we can better assess the effectiveness of universities and identify areas for improvement.

The Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) was first undertaken in 1986, as a UK-wide peer review exercise run on behalf of the four UK Higher Education (HE) funding bodies (The University of Edinburgh, 2016). This exercise was put in place to evaluate the quality of research within these institutions, utilising a 1-5* rating scale to measure quality (Council, 2013) – this has since been replaced.

In 2008 this initial exercise became jointly conducted by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), the Scottish Funding Council (SFC), the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), and the Department for Employment and Learning, Northern Ireland (DEL) (The University of Edinburgh, 2016). Another alteration was made in 2014 when the Research Excellence Framework (REF) was established.

The REF became the new system for assessing the quality of research in UK HE institutions, put in place to overtake the RAE (The University of St Andrews, 2014). This framework is now conducted every 4 years as a process of expert review (REF, 2021b). Expert panelists conduct the peer review for a total of 34 subject-based units of assessment (UOAs), using three weighted elements to form an overall scoring profile of each submission (The University of Sheffield, 2022).

The three elements which aid the assessment include the quality of outputs, the impact of our research beyond academia, and the environment that supports research (The University of Sheffield, 2022). The weightings of each element are as follows: Outputs 60%, Impact 25%, and Environment 15% (REF, 2021a). The change from RAE to REF also saw an alternation in the rating system; each submitted item is graded at one of 5 levels, starting at ‘unclassified’ and increasing to ‘4*’ (The University of Sheffield, 2022).

RAE and REF have three main aims: to provide accountability for public investment in research and produce evidence of the benefits of this investment; to provide benchmarking information and establish reputational yardsticks for use within the HE sector and for public information; to inform the selective allocation of funding for research (REF, 2021a). These aims aid in providing quality profiles of research activity across the HE sector (The University of Edinburgh, 2016) and provide reasoning for the selective allocation funding (REF, 2021b) – a total of £2 billion in public funding is invested in research annually (REF, 2021a). 

The 2021 REF reveals that 157 universities were assessed that year, an increase from the 2014 REF in which 154 universities were involved (REF, 2021a). Additionally, a comparison can be made regarding the proportion of submissions allocated within each grading level from 2014 to 2021. In 2014, 30% of submissions received a 4*, whilst 46% received a 3* grade (REF, 2014). In 2021, submissions receiving a 4* rating increased to 41%, whilst the proportion of 3* grades presented as 43% (REF, 2021a) – thus suggesting that the quality of submission has increased. In 2021, fewer submissions were placed in lower-level categories. This improvement in results in 2021 is suggestive of the fact that REF aims are being achieved as a higher proportion of submissions are achieving higher scores. Utilising this rating system also aids in providing accountability for public investment, as the scoring system helps in informing funding allocation decisions.
A significant change that has been seen since the initial RAE in 1986, and the introduction of REF in 2014, is the alterations regarding the weighting of each assessment element. In 2014, the ‘impact’ element, accounted for only 20% of the overall profile rating, however, this has since increased to 25% (McKay, 2017), and was utilised in the 2021 REF.

Additionally, a real-time REF review pilot was conducted during the 2021 REF assessment. The aims of this pilot study were first to gather initial data to address an evidence gap and secondly to test the feasibility of conducting a longitudinal study into the attitudes towards REF (Weinstein et al., 2019).

As of April 2018, the management of REF changed to Research England, who are part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) (Weinstein and Wilsdon, 2018). The same year, this management trialed a more formative approach to better understand the effect of the framework on institutions and individuals (Weinstein and Wilsdon, 2018).

Grove (2022) identifies that 84% of UK institutions ranked were in the leading two quality profiles, increasing overall sector GPA by 0.27 since 2014. Grove (2022) theorises that the increase in GPA is driven by universities focusing on research outputs, but is this the optimum system to measure research quality?

In 2017, the first Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) results were published in the UK. Announced by the Minister for Universities and Science Jo Johnson, the new TEF would complement the established REF in providing a range of information on institutional performance across the HE sector (Gunn, 2018).
Institutions that take part in the TEF are rated into four degrees of excellence: Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Requires Improvement. The TEF states that Gold standard universities have outstanding student experience and outcomes. Silver standard universities typically have very high student experience and outcomes with some outstanding features while Bronze standard universities typically have high standards with some very high quality features. Where there is an absence of excellence, a TEF rating will not be awarded. The published outcome will signal that the provider ‘Requires Improvement’ in order to be awarded a TEF rating (Office for Students, 2023).

The stated aim of the TEF given by government officials was to provide consumers with information regarding teaching quality to allow prospective students to judge whether the course fees were in line with the delivery of the course being offered. The framework proved controversial from the beginning. Following the publication of the TEF2 results, many expressed doubts about the accuracy of the TEF as a measure of teaching quality and noted different outcomes for universities over further education colleges (Matthews, 2019). It could be argued that proving a replacement framework served as an excuse for governments to attempt to raise tuition fees for universities achieving exemplary status beyond the currently capped course admission. Furthermore, considering the different outcomes given for universities compared to HE colleges, the focus could be placed more on promoting traditional highly regarded universities such as those in the Russel group rather than cheaper or more accessible alternatives.

Institutions given a Gold rating include the University of Bath, University of Cambridge, Falmouth University and the University of the West of England, among others. The University of Plymouth achieved a Silver rating in June 2018. Despite the controversial views held on the TEF, the results show that it is useful in highlighting the top providers of higher education in the UK, with many of the results not being unexpected and proving that the system, although potentially flawed, serves as a benchmark for future rankings.
